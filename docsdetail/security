Using FoundationIds in your project may present unique security concerns not normally thought of when using normal addresses.



One major area that needs to be approached with caution is the dual use of both addresses and foundationIds.

This came up when attempting to create a foundationId enablable token.  Because of the inablity to know how much gas it would take to edit all the balances for addresses associated with a FoundationId it makes it difficult to transfer from them.  If you were to create a separate balance only for foundationIds based off the original balances, then you can't 0 out the original balances because of the same loop gas problem.  So then if you don't 0 them out and the user later removes the addresses from the foundationId then the user suddenly has access to those balances again.

There are a few ways to deal with this.   One is to never have addresses and foundationIds mixed like this.  For a token you could just use foundationIds from the start.
